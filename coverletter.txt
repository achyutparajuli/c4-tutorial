 Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the internship opportunity at ING Skill Academy in the areas of Customer Success Representative and Digital Marketing. As a second-year Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) student at Informatics College Pokhara, I am eager to apply my growing skillset in a professional environment while learning from industry professionals.

I bring with me hands-on experience from helping manage my family-owned shop, where I learned valuable lessons in customer communication, basic sales, and informal marketing. This experience taught me how to interact with different types of people, solve problems on the spot, and stay calm under pressure. Skills that I believe align well with both the CSR and marketing roles you are offering. Please consider my request for any one position.

Additionally, I am familiar with tools like Canva, Google Workspace and social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. I enjoy exploring new digital trends and am eager to sharpen my communication and technical skills through real-world experience.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to ING Skill Academy while learning and growing professionally. I would welcome the opportunity for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,
Karan Lama Gurung
