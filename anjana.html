UI/UX Designer
Why: I enjoy creating clean, intuitive interfaces that enhance user experience. I'm passionate about making digital products not only look good but also feel easy and enjoyable to use. I love combining creativity with problem-solving to improve user journeys.

Front-End Developer
Why: I like bringing designs to life through code. It’s rewarding to see static mockups become fully interactive websites or apps. I’m interested in front-end development because it blends technical skills with visual creativity, and it gives me control over how users interact with a product.

Product Designer
Why: I’m drawn to the bigger picture of solving user problems through thoughtful design. Product design involves research, prototyping, and iteration, which really appeals to me. I like the idea of being involved from concept to final solution, ensuring it meets both user and business goals.

Interaction Designer
Why: I find it fascinating to design how users interact with digital products—not just how things look, but how they respond to input. I enjoy thinking about animations, transitions, and micro-interactions that make using a product feel smooth and engaging.
