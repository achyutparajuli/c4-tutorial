Full Stack
I love building things that work from start to finish. Full stack means I get to handle both the front and back of a website or app. It’s exciting to solve problems, make things run smoothly, and see my work help real people in real time.

Web Development
The internet connects us all, and I want to be part of that. Web development lets me create useful, beautiful websites that people can enjoy and learn from. It feels amazing to bring ideas to life and know that someone, somewhere, is clicking through what I built.

Data Analytics
I’ve always been curious about the “why” behind things. Data analytics helps me understand what’s really going on using numbers. I enjoy finding patterns, solving problems, and using those insights to make better choices. It’s like telling a story with data—and I love that.
UX/UI
I care about how people feel when they use something. UX/UI is about making sure apps and websites are easy, fun, and helpful. I like listening to people’s needs and designing with them in mind. If it makes someone smile or feel less frustrated, that’s success to me.
